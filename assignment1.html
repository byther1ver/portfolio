				<p>Reading Sarah Jones's piece <em>"404 Page Not Found"</em> in <em>The Baffler</em> got me thinking about the internet I grew up with and how different it is now, even in the relatively short period of time that I've been online. I wasn't present for the dawn of the internet, but my own experience started in the early 2010s when sites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube were already gigantic. In that time, I have witnessed significant changes, and Jones's article helped me better understand these shifts. </p>

				<p>One of the main points argued by Jones is that the internet has lost its sense of individuality. When I first started using social media, there was more freedom to be yourself, people would post unfiltered thoughts, their own jokes, and were not obsessed with likes. But as years went by, social media took on more of a performative nature. On Instagram, for example, many of the posts I see are for engagement rather than self expression. Jones describes how self-expression online has become a performance, and I see it everywhere now. It's like it's impossible to simply be on the internet, you have to curate your presence.</p>
				
				<p>Jones also talks about how some large companies now control the internet. When I was growing up, I did not think much about how much Google, Facebook, and Amazon influenced our online experiences and mindset. It just appeared to be the natural way the internet operates. However, reading Jones's article made me realize the tremendous impact that this monopoly has on our lives in the virtual world. YouTube used to be filled with strange, miscellaneous things, but now the same type of videos seem to reach the top, so the internet feels like a string of "locked rooms," as Jones puts it. It's harder to find those gems.</p>
				
				<p>Another point Jones raises is the way that sites profit by gathering our information. In my younger days, I displayed no concern for privacy, rushing to choose "agree" on all terms-of-service alerts without investigation. But over time, I have become more aware of the amount of data these sites collect. It is not just ads about products I have looked up, it includes ads about subjects I have talked about with friends. This constant surveillance has a profound effect on our internet behavior. I find myself beginning a post, then stopping, and wondering, "Who will read this? What are they going to do with it?" This is a reflection of the desire to incessantly second guess our decisions. Although Jones is writing skeptically about the internet of today, her article also made me hopeful. She discusses the potential for a decentralized web, where users are more in control, and creativity can once again flourish. This idea struck a chord with me strongly, as it pointed out the potential for change in the existing state of the internet. Supremacy of big platforms in today's time does not mean their continuity in the future. All efforts are still being directed toward creating alternatives, smaller platforms and independent communities that provide a more personalized experience and have less corporate control.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, Jones's article made me think about the internet in a totally different way. Although I didn't experience the early days, I can see how much was lost, and how much could still be gained. The internet of my childhood was corporate but also allowed for creativity and community. It seems that space is closing its chapter, but seeing how much the internet changes, I'm hopeful to be able to experience another great Renaissance of the internet.</p>
